# ML Algo Implementations

This repository stores some implementations of ML algorithms that I find interesting.
All the code here is super unoptimized and is just to demonstrate that I can understand the paper to the point that I can implement the algorithm.
I also am trying to use this to experiment with some different ML libraries I find intersting (Primarily JAX).
